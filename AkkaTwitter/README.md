# AkkaTwitter

The code in this module is based on
 - https://github.com/ftrossbach/intro-to-dcos for reading tweets and creating docker containers
 - https://github.com/eigengo/activator-akka-cassandra (see also http://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/activator-akka-cassandra ) for storing tweets in Cassandra

## Some notes on deploying Akka (Actors, and others)

> The code is [...] a straightforward Akka stream implementation. 
> Much more interesting is the deployment aspect. 
> The application is packaged as a docker container and deployed to a public docker registry [...]
> To deploy the app in our datacenter, we use DC/OSâ€™ scheduler Marathon and the DC/OS CLI. 
> A new deployment in Marathon is defined in JSON. [...]
> In this file, we specify the Docker container we want to deploy, some variables like the number of CPUs or memory, and most importantly some environment variables for the container.
